# Which-Pokemon-Are-Legendary
This was a machine learning assignment I completed as part of a Machine Learning module I studied in my 4th year software development course. We were required to build and train machine learning models that would correctly classify legendary pokemon. The data for Pokemon was part of csv files that were read in and split into training and test sets for model training and testing. 

The report I made for this assignment is the pdf file named "Which Pokemon Are Legendary" in the folder where you can see a breakdown of the performance of the models.
